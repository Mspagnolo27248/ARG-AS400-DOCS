The `AP205.rpg36.txt` file is an RPG III program (`AP205`) called within the `AP200.ocl36.txt` OCL procedure to summarize Accounts Payable (A/P) transactions for the Purchase Journal. Below, I provide a detailed explanation of its **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables/files used**, and **external programs called**, along with its purpose in the context of the `AP200` OCL procedure.

### **Purpose in AP200 OCL**
The `AP205` program is responsible for summarizing A/P journal entries from the Purchase Journal process initiated by `AP200`. It processes sorted journal register records (`APPJJR`), accumulates amounts for summarized A/P entries, and writes summarized or detailed journal entries to a temporary general ledger file (`TEMGEN`) and a printed report (`APPRINT`). This step finalizes the journal entries for A/P transactions, ensuring they are properly formatted for general ledger integration and reporting.

In the `AP200` OCL procedure, `AP205` is called after sorting the journal register (`APPJ?WS?` into `APPK?WS?`) to produce a summarized output, which is critical for financial reporting and ledger updates.

### **Process Steps**

1. **Initialization**:
   - **Set Indicators and Variables**:
     - Clears indicator `60` (`SETOF 60`).
     - Checks if the year/period (`KYYYPD`) in `APCONT` is non-zero; if zero, sets indicator `99` (`SETON 99`).
   - **Time and Date Setup**:
     - Retrieves system time (`TIME` to `TIMDAT`) and formats it into `TIME` (HHMMSS) and `DATE` (MMDDYY).
     - Converts `DATE` to `SYSYMD` (YYYYMMDD) by multiplying by 10000.01 and moves to `SYSDT8` (8-digit date).
   - **Page and Separator**:
     - Initializes page number (`PAGE`) to 0.
     - Sets separator (`SEP`) to `'* '` for report formatting.
   - **Company Lookup**:
     - Chains `PJCONO` (company number from `APPJJR`) to `APCONT` to retrieve company name (`ACNAME`). Sets indicator `94` if not found.

2. **Process Input Records (`APPJJR`)**:
   - **Read Input**:
     - Reads records from `APPJJR` (journal register file) at level `L4` (company level).
   - **Determine Debit/Credit**:
     - Compares `PJCORD` (credit/debit flag) to `'D'`; sets indicator `30` if debit (`DEBIT`).
   - **Summarize A/P Entries**:
     - Compares `PJTYPE` to `'AP      '`; sets indicator `20` if true (summarize A/P only).
   - **Accumulate Amount**:
     - Adds `PJAMT` (amount from `APPJJR`) to `L1AMT` (level 1 accumulator) for summarized entries.

3. **Date and Century Handling**:
   - Converts `PJDATE` (purchase journal date) to `YMD` (YYYYMMDD) by multiplying by 10000.01.
   - Extracts year (`YY`) from `YMD`.
   - Compares `YY` to `Y2KCMP` (80, from `APCONT`):
     - If `YY >= 80`, sets century (`CN`) to `Y2KCEN` (19).
     - Otherwise, adds 1 to `Y2KCEN` (e.g., 19 + 1 = 20).
   - Combines century and `YMD` into `CYMD` (century + YYYYMMDD).

4. **Journal Entry Processing**:
   - **Non-Summarized Entries**:
     - If not summarized (`N20`), calls `JRNL` subroutine to write detailed journal entries.
   - **Summarized Entries**:
     - At level `L1` (summary level) and if `PJTYPE = 'AP      '` (`20`), calls `JRNL` subroutine to write summarized A/P entries.

5. **JRNL Subroutine**:
   - Increments journal reference number (`JRREF#`).
   - Sets credit/debit flag (`CORD`) based on `PJCORD`:
     - If `L1AMT < 0` (indicator `10`), reverses sign of `L1AMT` and toggles `CORD` (`'C'` for credit, `'D'` for debit).
   - Accumulates amounts:
     - If debit (`CORD = 'D'`, indicator `11`), adds `L1AMT` to `L4DR` (debit total).
     - If credit (`CORD != 'D'`, `N11`), adds `L1AMT` to `L4CR` (credit total).
   - Sets journal amount (`JRAMT`) to `L1AMT` and resets `L1AMT` to 0.
   - Checks if gallons (`PJGALN`) is non-zero (sets indicator `60`).

6. **Write to Output Files**:
   - **TEMGEN (General Ledger File)**:
     - Writes detailed entries (`DADD 01N20`):
       - Includes company (`PJCONO`), G/L number (`PJGLNO`), journal number (`PJJRNL`), reference (`JRREF#`), credit/debit (`CORD`), description (`PJDES1` or `PJDES2`), vendor (`PJVN10`), date (`YMD`, `CYMD`), amount (`JRAMT`), gallons (`PJGALN`), and receipt (`PJRCPT`).
     - Writes summarized entries (`TADD L1 20`):
       - Similar fields but with fixed description (`'-SUMMARIZED A/P         '`) and `PJDATE`.
   - **APPRINT (Printed Report)**:
     - Prints header (`D 103 L4` or `OFNL4`):
       - Company name (`ACNAME`), page number, date (`DATE`), time (`TIME`), journal title (`PURCHASE JOURNAL`), and period (`KYPD`, `KYPDYY`).
     - Prints column headers for journal, reference, description, vendor, G/L number, debit/credit amounts.
     - Prints detailed entries (`D 1 01N20`):
       - Journal number, reference, description, vendor, G/L number, and amount (debit or credit).
       - Includes gallons and receipt number if `PJGALN` is non-zero (`60`).
     - Prints summarized entries (`T 1 L1 20`):
       - Similar format with `'-SUMMARIZED A/P'` description.
     - Prints journal totals (`T 2 L4`):
       - Debit total (`L4DR`) and credit total (`L4CR`).

7. **End Processing**:
   - Continues reading `APPJJR` records until end-of-file, processing each at appropriate levels (`L4`, `L1`).
   - Outputs final totals and closes files.

### **Business Rules**
1. **Summarization**:
   - Only records with `PJTYPE = 'AP      '` are summarized (indicator `20`).
   - Summarized entries aggregate amounts (`L1AMT`) by company and type, written at level `L1`.
2. **Debit/Credit Handling**:
   - Determines debit (`D`) or credit (`C`) based on `PJCORD`.
   - If amount is negative, reverses sign and toggles `CORD` (e.g., negative debit becomes credit).
3. **Year 2000 Compliance**:
   - Handles dates using `Y2KCEN` (century, default 19) and `Y2KCMP` (80) to determine if year is 19xx or 20xx.
4. **Error Checking**:
   - Validates year/period (`KYYYPD`) in `APCONT`; sets indicator `99` if invalid (zero).
   - Chains to `APCONT` for company name; sets indicator `94` if not found.
5. **Output Formatting**:
   - Detailed entries include vendor, gallons, and receipt data if applicable.
   - Summarized entries use a fixed description and aggregated amounts.
   - Report includes headers, totals, and formatted dates/amounts.
6. **Gallons and Receipt**:
   - Includes `PJGALN` (gallons) and `PJRCPT` (receipt number) in output only if `PJGALN` is non-zero.

### **Tables/Files Used**
- **Input**:
  - `APPJJR` (Primary Input, `IP`):
    - Journal register file (sorted input from `AP200`).
    - Fields: `PJDEL` (delete flag), `PJCONO` (company), `PJJRNL` (journal number), `PJCORD` (credit/debit), `PJGLNO` (G/L number), `PJDES1` (description 1), `PJDATE` (journal date), `PJAMT` (amount), `PJDES2` (description 2), `PJVN10` (vendor), `PJTYPE` (type), `PJGALN` (gallons), `PJRCPT` (receipt).

  - `APCONT` (Chained Input, `IC`):
    - A/P control file.

### **External Programs Called**
- **None**:
  - The `AP205` program does not call external programs. It relies on internal subroutines (`JRNL`) for processing.

---

### **Role in AP200 OCL**
In the `AP200` OCL procedure, `AP205` is called after sorting the journal register (`APPJ?WS?` into `APPK?WS?`) to:
- Summarize A/P transactions for the Purchase Journal.
- Generate a formatted report (`APPRINT`) for auditing and financial review.
- Write journal entries to `TEMGEN` for integration with the general ledger.
- Ensure accurate debit/credit totals and proper date handling for compliance.

This step is critical for consolidating A/P data into a summarized format, making it ready for ledger posting and reporting, which aligns with the overall goal of `AP200` to process and post A/P voucher transactions.

### **Key Notes**
- **Control Breaks**:
  - Uses `L4` (company), `L3` (credit/debit), `L2` (type), and `L1` (summary) for processing records hierarchically.
- **Y2K Handling**:
  - Ensures dates are correctly interpreted for 19xx or 20xx centuries.
- **Output Flexibility**:
  - Supports both detailed and summarized entries, with conditional inclusion of gallons and receipt data.
- **File Integration**:
  - Links with `APCONT` for company and period data, ensuring consistency with A/P controls.
