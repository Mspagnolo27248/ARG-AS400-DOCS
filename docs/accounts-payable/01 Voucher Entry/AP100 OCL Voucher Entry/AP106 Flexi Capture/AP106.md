The provided RPG program (`AP106.rpg36`) is executed as part of the Accounts Payable (A/P) voucher entry upload process for FlexiCapture imports on the IBM i (AS/400) system, as referenced in the OCL file (`AP106.ocl36.txt`). Below is a detailed explanation of the **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables/files used**, and **external programs called** in this RPG program.

---

### **Overview**
The `AP106` RPG program processes data from a FlexiCapture import file (`APINVUP`) and converts it into A/P voucher entries in the A/P transaction file (`APTRAN`). It validates vendor information, calculates due dates and discount due dates (adjusting for holidays and weekends), handles duplicate invoices based on batch numbers, and stores purchase order (PO) numbers. The program writes header and detail records to the transaction file and updates control data, ensuring proper integration with the A/P module.

### **Process Steps**

1. **Initialization**
   - Sets initial values for variables (e.g., zeros for `Z5`, `Z3`; blanks for `MSG`, `MSG2`).
   - Sets `PTYP` to `'FLEXI'` to indicate FlexiCapture import.
   - Initializes indicators (e.g., `50`, `51`, `60`, `61`, `90`) and retrieves system date/time (`TIMDAT`, `SYDATE`, `SYTIME`).
   - Converts the system date to YYMMDD format (`SYDYMD`) and extracts month (`MONTH`) and year (`YEAR`).
   - Sets indicator `09` to control the main processing loop.

2. **Check for Valid Import File**
   - Verifies that the import file path (`AUPATH`) is not blank. If blank, the program jumps to the `END` tag and terminates.

3. **Retrieve A/P Control Information**
   - Chains to the A/P control file (`APCONT`) using indicator `10` to retrieve control data.
   - Stores the A/P G/L account (`ACAPGL`) in `APGL` and the cash G/L account (`ACCAGL`) in `BKGL`.

4. **Process Import File Records**
   - Reads records from the import file (`APINVUP`) using the `01` input specification.
   - For each record, performs the following:
     - **Check for Duplicate Invoices**:
       - Compares the current invoice number (`AUINV#`), vendor number (`AUVEND`), and batch ID (`AUBTCH`) with saved values (`SVINV#`, `SVVEND`, `SVBTCH`).
       - If they match, treats the record as an additional detail line for the existing voucher and skips to the `AROUND` tag to process the detail.
     - **Get Entry Number**:
       - Retrieves the next entry number (`ACNXTE`) from `APCONT`.
       - If the entry number (`ENT#`) is zero, chains to `APTRAN` to check for conflicts, increments `ACNXTE` and `ENT#`, and updates `APCONT` via `RELAPC` exception output.
       - If `ENT#` is non-zero, assigns a new entry number, updates `ACNXTE`, and sets `RECSTS` to `'ADDNEW'`.
       - Handles overflow if `ENT#` reaches 99999.
     - **Validate Invoice Date**:
       - Converts the invoice date (`AUDATE`) to MMDDYY format (`INDT`).
       - Extracts month (`MM`), day (`DD`), and year (`YY`) for further processing.
     - **Retrieve Vendor Information**:
       - Chains to the vendor file (`APVEND`) using `AUVEND` to retrieve vendor details (e.g., name `VNVNAM`, addresses `VNAD1`–`VNAD4`, hold status `VNHOLD`, terms `VNTERM`).
       - Stores vendor data in fields like `VNAM`, `VAD1`–`VAD4`.
     - **Calculate Due Date**:
       - If the due date (`DUDT`) is zero and the vendor is not a one-time vendor (`AUVEND ≠ 0`), calls the `CLCDUE` subroutine to calculate the due date based on vendor terms (`VNTERM`).
       - Uses the general system table (`GSTABL`) to retrieve net days (`TBNETD`) or prox days (`TBPRXD`) for due date calculation.
       - If no terms are defined, defaults to the invoice date (`INDT`) or 30 days.
     - **Calculate Discount Due Date** (MG18):
       - If the discount due date (`DSDT`) is zero and the vendor is not one-time, calls the `CLCDSC` subroutine to calculate the discount due date based on discount days (`TBDISD`) from `GSTABL`.
       - Sets `DSDT` to zero if no discount days are defined.
     - **Validate Due Date for Holidays/Weekends** (MG17):
       - Chains to the A/P date file (`APDATE`) using the calculated due date (`DUDT8`) to check for holidays or weekends.
       - If a holiday/weekend is found, replaces `DUDT` with a non-holiday/weekend date (`ADNED8`).
     - **Validate Discount Due Date** (MG18):
       - Similarly checks the discount due date (`DSD8`) against `APDATE` and updates `DSDT` if necessary.
     - **Handle Vendor Hold Status**:
       - Sets the hold description (`HLDD`) based on the vendor hold status (`VNHOLD`):
         - `'A'`: Sets `HLDD` to "ON HOLD FOR ACH".
         - `'U'`: Sets `HLDD` to "ON HOLD FOR AUTOPAY".
         - `'E'`: Sets `HLDD` to "EMPLOYEE EXPENSE" and updates `BKGL` to the employee expense G/L (`ACEEGL`).
     - **Write Header Record**:
       - Calls the `HDRADD` subroutine to write a header record to `APTRAN` using the `HEADER` exception output.
       - Includes fields like entry number (`ACNXTE`), vendor number (`AUVEND`), invoice number (`AUINV#`), due date (`DUDT`), and vendor details.
     - **Process Detail Record**:
       - Populates detail fields (e.g., amount `AMT`, description `DDES`, G/L account `EXGL`, PO number `PONO`) from the import record.
       - Calculates discount percentage (`DSPC`) by multiplying `AUDSPC` by 10 if non-zero.
       - Writes a detail record to `APTRAN` using the `DETAIL` exception output.
       - Increments the line number (`NXLINE`) for the next detail.
     - **Save Current Record**:
       - Saves the invoice number (`AUINV#`), vendor number (`AUVEND`), batch ID (`AUBTCH`), and entry number (`ENT#`) to `SVINV#`, `SVVEND`, `SVBTCH`, and `SVENT#` for comparison with the next record.
     - **Reset Variables**:
       - Clears variables (e.g., `ENT#`, `TOTAL`, `SNGL`, `HOLD`) for the next record.
   - If the current invoice and vendor match the saved values, writes additional detail lines without creating a new header.

5. **End Processing**
   - Loops back to process the next import record until the end of the file.
   - Terminates at the `END` tag, closing files and ending the program.

### **Business Rules**

1. **Duplicate Invoice Handling** (MG19):
   - If the invoice number (`AUINV#`), vendor number (`AUVEND`), and batch ID (`AUBTCH`) match the previous record, the program treats it as an additional detail line for the same voucher rather than creating a new voucher.
   - This prevents duplicate vouchers for the same invoice within the same batch.

2. **Due Date Calculation**:
   - For non-one-time vendors (`AUVEND ≠ 0`), calculates the due date based on the vendor’s payment terms (`VNTERM`) from `GSTABL`:
     - Uses net days (`TBNETD`) or prox days (`TBPRXD`) to determine the due date.
     - Defaults to the invoice date (`INDT`) or 30 days if no terms are defined.
   - Adjusts the due date to avoid holidays and weekends using the `APDATE` table (MG17).

3. **Discount Due Date Calculation** (MG18):
   - Calculates the discount due date based on discount days (`TBDISD`) from `GSTABL` for non-one-time vendors.
   - Sets the discount due date to zero if no discount days are defined.
   - Adjusts for holidays and weekends using `APDATE`.

4. **Vendor Hold Status**:
   - Applies hold descriptions based on the vendor’s hold status (`VNHOLD`):
     - `'A'`: On hold for ACH payments.
     - `'U'`: On hold for autopay.
     - `'E'`: Employee expense, with the G/L account updated to `ACEEGL`.

5. **Invoice Date Validation**:
   - Ensures the invoice date (`AUDATE`) is converted to a valid MMDDYY format (`INDT`).
   - Handles century calculation for Y2K compliance using `Y2KCEN` and `Y2KCMP`.

6. **PO Number Storage** (MG20):
   - Stores the PO number (`AUPONM`) from the import file in the A/P transaction file (`ATPONO`) for both header and detail records.

7. **Entry Number Management**:
   - Increments the next entry number (`ACNXTE`) from `APCONT` for each new voucher.
   - Handles overflow (entry number > 99999) by resetting and updating `ACNXTE`.

8. **Detail Line Description** (MG17):
   - Copies the invoice description (`AUHDSC`) from the header to the detail record (`DDES`) for new records.

9. **Discount Percentage**:
   - If a discount percentage (`AUDSPC`) is provided, multiplies it by 10 to store in `DSPC`.

### **External Programs Called**

No external programs are explicitly called via `CALL` operations in this RPG program. However, the program relies on subroutines defined within itself for specific tasks:

1. **CLCDUE**: Calculates the due date based on vendor terms (`VNTERM`), using net days (`TBNETD`) or prox days (`TBPRXD`).
2. **CLCDSC**: Calculates the discount due date based on discount days (`TBDISD`).
3. **HDRADD**: Writes the header record to `APTRAN`.
4. **TMDATN**: Adds net days to the invoice date to calculate the due date.
5. **TMDATS**: Adds discount days to the invoice date to calculate the discount due date.
6. **TMDATP**: Calculates the due date for prox terms (e.g., next month’s specific day).
7. **@DTE1**: Converts a Gregorian date (MMDDYY) to Julian format for date calculations.
8. **@DTE2**: Converts a Julian date back to Gregorian format.

These subroutines handle date calculations, record writing, and terms processing internally.
