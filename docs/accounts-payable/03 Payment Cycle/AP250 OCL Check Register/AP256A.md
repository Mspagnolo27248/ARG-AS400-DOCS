The RPG program `AP256A.RPG` is invoked by the OCL procedure `AP256A` as a preprocessing step before `AP256.RPG36` in the Accounts Payable (A/P) Check Register process. Its primary purpose is to create or update the `APDTWSC` file, which stores the count of email addresses for ACH vendors based on records in the `APVNFMX` file. This information is used by `AP256.RPG36` to generate vendor payment detail reports. Below is a detailed explanation of the **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables/files used**, and **external programs called**, as requested.

### Process Steps

The `AP256A.RPG` program processes payment records from the `APDTWS` file, retrieves email information from the `APVNFMX` file, and writes or updates records in the `APDTWSC` file with the count of valid ACH email addresses for each vendor. The program is structured around a single main processing loop without explicit subroutines. The steps are as follows:

1. **Process Each Payment Record**:
   - Reads records from the primary input file `APDTWS` (indicator `01`).
   - For each record, constructs a key (`KEY20`, 20 bytes) to access the `APVNFMX` file:
     - Copies the company/vendor key (`ADCOVN`, positions 2–8) to `KEY20`.
     - Appends the form type `'ACHE'` (ACH email) to a temporary key (`KEY13`) and combines it into `KEY20`.
   - Sets the lower limit (`SETLL`) on `APVNFMX` using `KEY20` to position the file pointer.

2. **Count Valid Email Addresses**:
   - Initializes a counter (`COUNT`) to zero.
   - Reads `APVNFMX` records sequentially, looping until end-of-file (indicator `10`) or a mismatch occurs:
     - Skips records where the company/vendor key (`ADCOVN`) does not match `AMCOVN` (from `APVNFMX`).
     - Skips records where the form type (`AMFMTY`) is not `'ACHE'`.
     - Increments `COUNT` for each valid record (matching `ADCOVN` and `AMFMTY = 'ACHE'`).
     - Continues looping (`GOTO AGAIN`) until all relevant records are processed or a mismatch/end is reached.

3. **Update or Add APDTWSC Record**:
   - Chains to the `APDTWSC` file using `ADCOVN` to check for an existing record (sets indicator `98` if not found).
   - Writes or updates a record in `APDTWSC`:
     - If no record exists (`98` on), writes a new record (`DADD`) with:
       - `ADCOVN` (company/vendor key, positions 2–8).
       - `COUNT` (number of valid email addresses, packed, positions 9–10).
     - If a record exists (`N98`), updates the existing record with the new `COUNT` value.

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules:

1. **Email Address Counting**:
   - Counts only `APVNFMX` records where:
     - The company/vendor key matches (`ADCOVN = AMCOVN`).
     - The form type is `'ACHE'` (indicating ACH email notifications).
   - The count (`COUNT`) represents the number of valid email addresses for the vendor, which will be used by `AP256.RPG36` to determine how many reports to generate (up to four).

2. **Record Matching**:
   - Uses `ADCOVN` (company number + vendor number) as the key to match records between `APDTWS`, `APVNFMX`, and `APDTWSC`.
   - Skips non-matching or irrelevant records in `APVNFMX` to ensure only ACH-related email addresses are counted.

3. **APDTWSC File Maintenance**:
   - Creates a new record in `APDTWSC` if no matching record exists for the company/vendor key (`98` on).
   - Updates the existing record if found (`N98`), overwriting the email count (`COUNT`).
   - Ensures the `APDTWSC` file contains one record per company/vendor with the correct email address count.

4. **No Error Logging**:
   - The program does not log errors or generate output reports if records are not found or skipped; it silently continues processing.

5. **Single-Pass Processing**:
   - Processes each `APDTWS` record once, calculating the email count and updating `APDTWSC` immediately.

### Tables/Files Used

The program interacts with the following files, as defined in the OCL and RPG source:

| **Logical Name** | **Label**         | **Usage**                                                                 | **Disposition** | **Record Length** |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| APDTWS           | ?9?APDT?WS?       | Input: ACH payment data (company, vendor, invoice, amounts, check date).  | Input (IP)      | 256               |
| APVNFMX          | ?9?APVNFMX        | Input: Vendor email/fax details (email addresses, form type).             | Input (IF)      | 266               |
| APDTWSC          | ?9?APDT?WS?C      | Output/Update: ACH vendor control (company/vendor key, email count).      | Update (UF)     | 10                |

**Key Fields**:
- **APDTWS**:
  - `ADCO` (company number, positions 2–3)
  - `ADVEND` (vendor number, positions 4–8)
  - `ADCOVN` (company/vendor key, positions 2–8)
- **APVNFMX**:
  - `AMCONO` (company number, positions 2–3)
  - `AMCVEN` (vendor number, positions 4–8)
  - `AMCOVN` (company/vendor key, positions 2–8)
  - `AMFMTY` (form type, positions 9–12, must be `'ACHE'`)
- **APDTWSC**:
  - `ADCOVN` (company/vendor key, positions 2–8)
  - `COUNT` (email address count, packed, positions 9–10)

### External Programs Called

The `AP256A.RPG` program does not explicitly call any external programs. All processing is handled internally within the main loop. The program is a preprocessing step for `AP256.RPG36`, which relies on the `APDTWSC` file being populated with the correct email address counts.

### Notes
- **OCL Context**:
  - The OCL procedure `AP256A` creates the `APDTWSC` file with a capacity of 50 records and a record length of 10 bytes, using the `BLDFILE` command.
  - The `RETAIN-T` parameter ensures the file is temporary, and `DISP-SHR` allows shared access for `APVNFMX`.
- **Purpose**:
  - The program prepares the `APDTWSC` file by counting valid ACH email addresses per vendor, enabling `AP256.RPG36` to generate the appropriate number of payment detail reports (up to four per vendor).
- **Error Handling**:
  - Skips non-matching or non-ACH records in `APVNFMX` without logging errors.
  - Handles missing `APDTWSC` records by creating new ones (`DADD`) when necessary.
- **Modifications**:
  - No explicit modification history is noted in the provided code, but the program aligns with the `AP256.RPG36` enhancements (e.g., supporting up to four email addresses, added 5-13-19).
- **Efficiency**:
  - Uses `SETLL` and sequential reads to efficiently count email addresses, minimizing file access overhead.
  - Writes or updates `APDTWSC` records only once per vendor, reducing I/O operations.
