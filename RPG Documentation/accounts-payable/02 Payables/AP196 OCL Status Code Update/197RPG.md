The `AP197.rpg36.txt` file is an RPG III program (`AP197`) designed to generate an edit report for the A/P Voucher Status Code Update process, complementing the functionality of `AP196` described previously. Below, I provide a detailed explanation of what this program does, including its process steps, business rules, tables used, and any external programs called, formatted consistently with the prior response.

### **Overview of What AP197 Does**

The `AP197` program is responsible for producing a printed report that lists the details of voucher status code changes made by the `AP196` program. It reads records from the voucher control file (`APVCTR`), retrieves associated company and vendor information, and formats a report to display vendor details, voucher numbers, current status codes, and their descriptions. The report serves as an audit trail or error-checking mechanism to verify the modifications made to voucher status codes, highlighting whether prior hold codes existed.

This program is called by the OCL script (`AP196.ocl36.txt`) when records remain in `APVCTR` after `AP196` execution, ensuring that any changes are documented for review.

### **Process Steps**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Retrieves the system time and date (`TIMDAT`) and formats them into `SYSTIM` (time) and `SYSDAT` (date) for inclusion in the report header.
   - Initializes the page counter (`PAGE`) to zero.
   - Sets a separator line (`SEP`) to "* " for formatting the report.

2. **Processing by Company (Level Break L2)**:
   - Loops through records in `APVCTR` grouped by company number (`ATCONO`), using the level break indicator `L2`.
   - For each company:
     - Chains (looks up) the company number in `APCONT` to retrieve the company name (`ACNAME`).
     - If the company is not found (indicator 92 on), the company name is not printed in the report header.
     - Initializes a field `L2CLAM` (likely a claim amount, but unused in output) to zero.

3. **Detail Record Processing**:
   - For each record in `APVCTR`:
     - Checks if the open hold code (`ATOHLD`) and open hold description (`ATOHDS`) are blank.
     - If both are blank, sets indicator 50 to indicate "NO PRIOR HOLD CODE" in the report.
     - Constructs a vendor key (`VENKEY`) by combining the company number (`ATCONO`) and vendor number (`ATVEND`).
     - Chains the vendor key to `APVEND` to retrieve the vendor name (`VNAME`).
     - If the vendor is not found (indicator 99 on), clears the vendor name (`VENDNM`) to blanks.
     - Writes a detail line to the report (`LIST`), including:
       - Vendor number (`ATVEND`).
       - Vendor name (`VENDNM`).
       - Voucher number (`ATVOUC`).
       - Current hold code (`ATHOLD`).
       - Current hold description (`ATHLDS`).
       - Open hold code (`ATOHLD`) and description (`ATOHDS`), if present; otherwise, "NO PRIOR HOLD CODE" is printed.

4. **Report Formatting**:
   - Outputs a report header for each company (on `L2` break or overflow):
     - Includes the company name (`ACNAME`), page number (`PAGE`), and system date (`SYSDAT`).
     - Prints a title: "A/P VOUCHER STATUS CODE MODIFY EDIT" with the system time (`SYSTIM`).
   - Outputs column headings:
     - "VENDOR", "NAME", "VOUCHER NUMBER", "STATUS CODE", "CODE DESCRIPTION", "CURRENT VALUES".
   - Uses separator lines (`SEP`) to visually separate sections.
   - Handles overflow (`OF`) to ensure proper pagination.

5. **Output Generation**:
   - Writes the formatted report to the printer file (`LIST`), which is directed to an output queue (e.g., `QUSRSYS/APSTEDIT` or `QUSRSYS/TESTOUTQ`) as specified in the OCL script.

### **Business Rules**

1. **Data Validation**:
   - The program assumes that records in `APVCTR` are valid, as they are pre-processed by `AP196`.
   - Company numbers (`ATCONO`) are validated against `APCONT`. If not found, the company name is omitted from the report header.
   - Vendor numbers (`ATVEND`) are validated against `APVEND`. If not found, the vendor name is set to blanks in the report.

2. **Hold Code Reporting**:
   - If the open hold code (`ATOHLD`) and description (`ATOHDS`) are both blank, the report indicates "NO PRIOR HOLD CODE".
   - Otherwise, the open hold code and description are printed to show the prior status.

3. **Report Structure**:
   - The report is grouped by company number (`ATCONO`), with a header printed for each company.
   - Detail lines list each voucher's status, including current and prior hold codes.
   - Page breaks are managed using the overflow indicator (`OF`) and level break (`L2`).

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Missing company or vendor records do not halt the program; instead, blank values are used in the report.
   - The program does not modify any files, ensuring it is read-only and safe for audit purposes.

5. **Output Destination**:
   - The report is sent to the printer file (`LIST`), with the output queue controlled by the OCL script (`AP196.ocl36.txt`).

### **Tables Used**

The following files (tables) are referenced in the `AP197` program:

1. **`APVCTR` (Voucher Control File)**:
   - **Type**: Input primary file (`IP` in RPG).
   - **Fields**:
     - `ATDEL` (delete flag, 1 byte, not used in output).
     - `ATCONO` (company number, 2 bytes, used for level break and lookup).
     - `ATVEND` (vendor number, 5 bytes).
     - `ATVOUC` (voucher number, 5 bytes).
     - `ATHOLD` (current hold code, 1 byte).
     - `ATHLDS` (current hold description, 25 bytes).
     - `ATOHLD` (open hold code, 1 byte).
     - `ATOHDS` (open hold description, 25 bytes).
   - **Purpose**: Primary input file containing voucher status records to be reported.

2. **`APCONT` (Company Master File)**:
   - **Type**: Input chained file (`IC` in RPG).
   - **Fields**:
     - `ACNAME` (company name, 30 bytes).

4. **`LIST` (Printer File)**:
   - **Type**: Output file (`O` in RPG).
   - **Purpose**: Defines the report output format, with a line length of 132 characters. Used to print the edit report.

### **External Programs Called**

- **None**:
  The `AP197` program does not call any external programs. It is a standalone report generator invoked by the OCL script (`AP196.ocl36.txt`) when needed.

### **Detailed Summary**

- **Purpose**: The `AP197` program generates an edit report to document changes to voucher status codes made by `AP196`, serving as an audit or verification tool.
- **Process**: Reads `APVCTR` records, retrieves company and vendor details, and formats a report with headers, column headings, and detail lines showing voucher status codes and descriptions.
- **Business Rules**: Validates company and vendor data, handles missing records gracefully, and flags vouchers with no prior hold codes.
- **Tables**: Uses `APVCTR` (primary input), `APCONT` (company lookup), `APVEND` (vendor lookup), and `LIST` (report output).
- **External Programs**: None; operates independently under the control of the OCL script.

This program is a typical AS/400 reporting application, designed to provide a clear, structured output for financial oversight in an accounts payable context.
