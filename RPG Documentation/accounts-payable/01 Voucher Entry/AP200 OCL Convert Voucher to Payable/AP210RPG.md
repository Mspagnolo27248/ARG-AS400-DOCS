The `AP210.rpg36.txt` file is an RPG III program (`AP210`) called within the `AP200.ocl36.txt` OCL procedure to post Accounts Payable (A/P) invoices to inventory receipt records. Below, I provide a detailed explanation of its **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables/files used**, and **external programs called**, along with its purpose in the context of the `AP200` OCL procedure.

### **Purpose in AP200 OCL**
The `AP210` program is responsible for updating inventory receipt records (`INFIL1` or `INTZH1`) with A/P invoice data from the transaction file (`APTRAN`). It matches A/P invoices to inventory receipts based on receipt numbers, updates quantities, amounts, and status, and logs the activity in a printer output file (`APLIST`). In the `AP200` OCL procedure, `AP210` is called after the main Purchase Journal processing to ensure A/P invoices are reflected in inventory records, which is critical for tracking costs and quantities associated with inventory receipts.

### **Process Steps**

1. **Initialization**:
   - **Date and Century Handling**:
     - Retrieves journal date (`JRDATE`) from the User Data Structure (`UDS`).
     - Converts `JRDATE` to `JRYMD` (YYYYMMDD) by multiplying by 10000.01.
     - Extracts year (`JYR`) and compares it to `Y2KCMP` (80, from `UDS`):
       - If `JYR >= 80`, sets century (`JCN`) to `Y2KCEN` (19).
       - Otherwise, adds 1 to `Y2KCEN` (e.g., 19 + 1 = 20).
     - Combines century and `JRYMD` into `JRYM8` (century + YYYYMMDD).
   - **Variable Setup**:
     - Clears indicators `20`, `90`, `91`, `92` and sets zero fields (`ZERO2`, `ZERO4`, `ZERO6`, `ZERO8`) to 0.
     - Sets `ONCE` to 1 to ensure date processing occurs only once.
   - **Amount Setup**:
     - Moves `APGRAM` (gross amount from `APTRAN`) to `APAMT` (working amount field).

2. **Skip Deleted or Sales Order Records**:
   - Checks if `ATSORN` (sales order number) is zero (`IFEQ *ZERO`):
     - If non-zero, skips to `END` (bypasses posting for sales order-related invoices, per `JB01` revision).
   - Checks if header (`APHDEL`) or detail (`APDDEL`) delete flags are not `'D'`:
     - If either is deleted, skips to `END`.

3. **Process A/P Invoice**:
   - **Determine Processing Type**:
     - If indicator `20` is off (`N20`), calls `NORMAL` subroutine (standard invoice processing).
     - If indicator `20` is on, calls `FREIGH` subroutine (freight invoice processing, which sets indicator `11` and calls `NORMAL`).
   - **Receipt Key**:
     - Builds `RCTKEY` (9 bytes) by combining `APCONO` (company number, 3 bytes) and `APREC#` (receipt number, 6 bytes).
   - **Log to Printer**:
     - Writes detail record to `APLIST` (`EXCPTDTL`) with invoice details (company, vendor, invoice number, date, G/L, receipt, gallons, amount, status).

4. **NORMAL Subroutine**:
   - **Match Receipt (Exact Match)**:
     - Sets lower limit (`SETLL`) on `INFIL1` and `INTZH1` using `RCTKEY`.
     - Reads `INFIL1` (indicator `76`) until end-of-file (`90`) or match.
     - If end-of-file on `INFIL1`, switches to `INTZH1` (indicator `77`) and reads.
     - If a match is found (`N90`):
       - Calculates remaining quantity (`RNQTY = IHNQTY + IHNQTF - IHAPTQ - IHAPTF`).
       - If `APGAL` (A/P gallons) equals `RNQTY`, updates the record:
         - Adds `APAMT` to `IHAPTD` (total dollars).
         - Adds `APGAL` to `IHAPTQ` (total quantity).
         - Sets `IHCLCD` (status) to `'O'` (open) or `'C'` (closed) based on `APCLCD`.
         - Updates `IHCLDT` (closed date, YMD) and `IHCLD8` (closed date, CYMD) with `JRYMD` and `JRYM8`.
         - Updates `APINVN` (invoice number) and `IHPONO` (PO number).
         - Writes update to `INFIL1` or `INTZH1` (`EXCPTUPDRCP`).
         - Logs to `APLIST` (`EXCPTDT01`).
         - Clears `APAMT` and `APGAL`.

   - **Match Receipt (Partial Match)**:
     - If no exact match, re-reads `INFIL1` and `INTZH1` to find a record with more gallons than `APGAL`.
     - If found (`N90` and `APGAL < RNQTY`):
       - Updates `IHAPTD`, `IHAPTQ`, `IHCLCD`, `IHCLDT`, `IHCLD8`, `APINVN`, and `IHPONO` as above.
       - Writes update (`EXCPTUPDRCP`).
       - Logs to `APLIST` (`EXCPTDT02`).
       - Clears `APAMT` and `APGAL`.

   - **No Match, Update First Record**:
     - If no match and `APGAL` is non-zero, reads first record from `INFIL1` or `INTZH1`.
     - Updates `IHAPTD`, `IHAPTQ`, `IHCLCD`, `IHCLDT`, `IHCLD8`, `APINVN`, and `IHPONO`.
     - Writes update (`EXCPTUPDRCP`).
     - Logs to `APLIST` (`EXCPTDT03`).
     - Clears `APAMT` and `APGAL`.

5. **FREIGH Subroutine**:
   - Sets indicator `11` to flag freight processing.
   - Calls `NORMAL` subroutine to process freight invoices similarly to standard invoices.
   - Clears indicator `11`.

6. **End Processing**:
   - Continues reading `APTRAN` records until end-of-file.
   - Closes files and terminates.

### **Business Rules**
1. **Skip Sales Orders** (`JB01`, 07/08/10):
   - Bypasses posting if `ATSORN` (sales order number) is non-zero, as sales order invoices are not posted to inventory receipts.
2. **Skip Deleted Records**:
   - Skips records where `APHDEL` or `APDDEL` is `'D'` (deleted).
3. **Dual File Support** (`JB02`, 09/18/14):
   - Checks both `INFIL1` (inventory file) and `INTZH1` (holding file) for receipt matches, switching if no match is found in `INFIL1`.
4. **Quantity Matching**:
   - Matches A/P gallons (`APGAL`) to remaining receipt quantity (`IHNQTY + IHNQTF - IHAPTQ - IHAPTF`).
   - Updates the first record with sufficient gallons or the first available record if no match.
5. **Status Update**:
   - Sets `IHCLCD` to `'O'` (open) or `'C'` (closed) based on `APCLCD`.
   - Updates closed dates (`IHCLDT`, `IHCLD8`) with journal date.
6. **Freight Invoices**:
   - Processes freight invoices separately but uses the same `NORMAL` logic (indicator `11` flags freight).
7. **Printer Logging** (`JB03`, 09/18/14):
   - Logs all updates to `APLIST` for debugging and verification, with distinct exception records (`DTL`, `DT01`, `DT02`, `DT03`).
8. **Y2K Compliance**:
   - Handles dates using `Y2KCEN` (19) and `Y2KCMP` (80) to determine 19xx or 20xx century.
9. **Field Updates** (`MG04`, 09/15/15):
   - Supports expanded `INFIL1` (448 bytes) and `APINVN` (20 bytes).
   - Includes PO number (`IHPONO`) from the purchase order system.

### **External Programs Called**
- **None**:
  - The `AP210` program does not call external programs. It relies on internal subroutines (`NORMAL`, `FREIGH`) for processing.

### **Role in AP200 OCL**
In the `AP200` OCL procedure, `AP210` is called after the main Purchase Journal processing (`AP200`) and journal summarization (`AP205`) to:
- Post A/P invoice data (amounts, quantities, invoice numbers, PO numbers) to inventory receipt records in `INFIL1` or `INTZH1`.
- Ensure inventory records reflect A/P costs and quantities, maintaining alignment between financial and inventory systems.
- Log updates to `APLIST` for verification, especially useful for debugging (per `JB03`).
- Support freight invoices and bypass sales order-related invoices, ensuring accurate inventory cost tracking.

This step is critical for integrating A/P transactions with inventory management, ensuring that receipt records are updated with financial data for accurate cost tracking and reporting.

### **Key Notes**
- **Revisions**:
  - `JB01` (07/08/10): Bypasses sales order invoices.
  - `JB02` (09/18/14): Adds support for `INTZH1` (holding file).
  - `JB03` (09/18/14): Adds `APLIST` for logging.
  - `MG04` (09/15/15): Expands `INFIL1` and adds invoice number (`APINVN`) and PO number (`IHPONO`).
- **File Switching**:
  - Dynamically switches between `INFIL1` and `INTZH1` if no match is found, ensuring flexibility in receipt processing.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Skips deleted records and non-inventory invoices (e.g., sales orders).
  - Logs all updates for traceability.
- **Quantity Logic**:
  - Matches A/P gallons to receipt quantities, updating the first suitable record if no exact match is found.
