The provided RPG program (`AP107.rpg36.txt`) is executed as part of the Accounts Payable (A/P) voucher entry upload process for FlexiCapture imports on the IBM i (AS/400) system, as referenced in the OCL file (`AP106.ocl36.txt`). Below is a detailed explanation of the **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables/files used**, and **external programs called** in this RPG program.

---

### **Overview**
The `AP107` RPG program is a simple utility that reads records from the FlexiCapture import file (`APINVUP`) and writes them to the FlexiCapture history table (`APFLEXH`) for record-keeping. It captures metadata such as the date, time, user, and workstation, ensuring an audit trail of uploaded data. This program is called before `AP106` to archive the import data prior to further processing.

### **Process Steps**

1. **Initialization**
   - Upon reading each record from the input file (`APINVUP`) (indicated by `01`), the program retrieves the current system date and time using the `TIME` operation, storing them in `TIMDAT` (12 digits, HHMMSSYYYYMMDD format).
   - Extracts the time (`SYTIME`, HHMMSS) and date (`SYDATE`, MMDDYY) from `TIMDAT`.
   - Converts the date to YYMMDD format (`SYDYMD`) by multiplying `SYDATE` by 10000.01.
   - Extracts the month (`MONTH`) from `SYDATE`.
   - Formats the date as an 8-digit field (`DATE8`, YYYYMMDD) by combining a century prefix (`20`) with `SYDYMD`.
   - Stores the time in a 6-digit field (`TIME6`, HHMMSS).
   - Retrieves the user ID (`USER`) and workstation ID (`WRKSTN`) from the User Data Structure (UDS, fields at positions 400–409 and 410–414).

2. **Write to History Table**
   - For each record read from `APINVUP`, the program writes a record to the FlexiCapture history table (`APFLEXH`) using the `DADD` exception output (indicated by `01`).
   - The output record includes:
     - The entire input record split into six segments (`REC1`–`REC6`, covering positions 1–1090 of `APINVUP`).
     - The formatted date (`DATE8`, positions 1091–1098).
     - The formatted time (`TIME6`, positions 1099–1104).
     - The user ID (`USER`, positions 1105–1114).
     - The workstation ID (`WRKSTN`, positions 1115–1129).

3. **Loop and Termination**
   - The program continues reading and processing `APINVUP` records until the end of the file.
   - No explicit termination logic is shown, but the program ends naturally when all input records are processed, closing files automatically.

### **Business Rules**

1. **Audit Trail Creation**:
   - Every record from the FlexiCapture import file (`APINVUP`) is archived in the history table (`APFLEXH`) without modification.
   - Metadata (date, time, user, workstation) is appended to each record to track when and by whom the data was uploaded.

2. **Data Preservation**:
   - The program does not validate or modify the input data; it copies all fields (`REC1`–`REC6`) directly to the output file.
   - This ensures a complete and unaltered record of the import data for auditing or recovery purposes.

3. **System Metadata**:
   - The program uses system-provided date/time (`TIMDAT`) and user/workstation information from the UDS to populate audit fields.
   - The date is formatted as YYYYMMDD (`DATE8`) with a hardcoded century prefix (`20`), assuming all dates are in the 2000s.

### **Tables/Files Used**

The program interacts with the following database files, identified by their file names, labels, and purposes:

| **File Name** | **Label** | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Access Type** | **Used For** |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| APINVUP       | APINVUP   | Input file containing FlexiCapture import data (e.g., invoice, vendor, amount). | Input (IP)      | Reading import records. |
| APFLEXH       | APFLEXH   | FlexiCapture history table storing archived import records with audit metadata. | Output (O)      | Writing history records. |

**File Details**:
- **APINVUP**:
  - Record length: 1090 bytes.
  - Fields include invoice number (`AUINV#`), vendor number (`AUVEND`), total amount (`AUTOTL`), PO number (`AUPONM`), and others.
  - Also mapped to six segments (`REC1`–`REC6`) for direct copying (positions 1–256, 257–512, 513–750, 751–810, 811–1000, 1001–1090).
- **APFLEXH**:
  - Record length: 1129 bytes.
  - Includes the 1090 bytes from `APINVUP` (`REC1`–`REC6`) plus additional fields:
    - `DATE8` (8 bytes, YYYYMMDD, positions 1091–1098).
    - `TIME6` (6 bytes, HHMMSS, positions 1099–1104).
    - `USER` (10 bytes, user ID, positions 1105–1114).
    - `WRKSTN` (15 bytes, workstation ID, positions 1115–1129).

### **External Programs Called**

- **None**:
  - The `AP107` program does not explicitly call any external programs or subroutines via `CALL` operations.
  - All processing is self-contained, relying on basic RPG operations (`TIME`, `MOVEL`, `MOVE`, `MULT`) and file I/O.

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **Simplicity**: The program is straightforward, designed solely to archive `APINVUP` records in `APFLEXH` with audit metadata. It lacks complex logic or validation, deferring such tasks to other programs (e.g., `AP106`).
- **Y2K Assumption**: The program assumes all dates are in the 21st century by prefixing `20` to the year in `DATE8`. This may cause issues for dates before 2000 or after 2099, though unlikely given the context.
- **UDS Usage**: The User Data Structure (UDS) provides user and workstation information, which is standard in IBM i RPG programs for audit purposes.
- **File Access**:
  - `APINVUP` is read sequentially as a primary file (`IP`).
  - `APFLEXH` is an output file (`O`) with records added (`A`) via exception output (`DADD`).

### **Summary**

- **Process Steps**: Reads each record from `APINVUP`, captures system date/time and user/workstation metadata, and writes the record plus metadata to `APFLEXH`.
- **Business Rules**: Archives all import records without modification, appending audit metadata (date, time, user, workstation) for tracking.
- **Files Used**: `APINVUP` (input, import data), `APFLEXH` (output, history with audit metadata).
- **External Programs**: None; all logic is internal.
